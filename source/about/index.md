Hi, there!

I am Nofated, aka Nofated095, nof, nof095! I am a personal developer, an anime fan, and a medicine and chemisty lover.

I am one of the community supports of LittleSkin, which is the second largest Minecraft offline skin provider service.

The blog you are visiting was started in 2020, which is a very uncommon year.
